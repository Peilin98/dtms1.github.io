        Site Location & Enviroment Analysis
      </h3>

      <p1>
        <br>The elliptical plot of land defined by the intersection of Flatbush Ave, Plaza St W, 
        and Vanderbilt Ave is known as Grand Army Plaza. On all sides, the plaza is surrounded 
        by 4 lanes of roundabout traffic, but offers a couple of access points for pedestrians 
        to the north and to the south. Ultimately, this plaza leads into the larger Prospect Park, 
        and serves as an open forum space, allowing for the occurrence of markets and impromptu 
        large gatherings. 
        
        <li>Our reason for selecting this site as the basis for our intervention is due to three factors.</li>
        
        <br><br>1. The site acts as an island of sorts, separated from the larger context by roadways 
        and heavy vehicular traffic. This is interesting because of the participatory nature 
        of the pedestrians who enter the plaza - it takes effort for them to venture across.
        
        <br><br>2. In addition, the site benefits from its proximity to the entrance of Prospect Park 
        and the Grand Army Plaza subway stop, effectively creating a thoroughfare between the two. 
        Not only is the plaza participatory by pedestrians, it's also considered essential.
        
        <br><br>3. The entrance to Prospect Park plays host to various events throughout the year and 
        becomes a dynamic element that tends to spill traffic over onto the Plaza.

       <h3>
        Site History
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        <br>Grand Army Plaza was initially conceived in 1866 as “The Plaza,” the decorated 
        entrance to the (then newly planned) Prospect Park which sought to distance visitors 
        from the chaos of the city beyond. The constituent parts of the Plaza as we recognize 
        them today came subsequently, with the Soldiers and Sailers Memorial Arch in 1892, the 
        Four Columns in 1896, the Bailey Fountain in 1932, and the bust of John F Kennedy in 1965. 
        Early on, during the inception of the plaza,  thoroughfares surrounding the park were utilized 
        primarily by trolleys. It was only with the advent of the automobile did traffic become a serious 
        problem, even prompting a site specific “death-o-meter” which tracked traffic fatalities across 
        Brooklyn. Although the site has received mixed reviews throughout its time, it was eventually 
        designated an official city landmark in 1975, effectively preserving all the aspects of 
        the plaza we see today.

        Design Process

      <p>
        I broke down the coffee grinder into smaller shape like rectangle 
        and cicrle. I drawed it on the paper, and adjusted the size to match
        how I pictured in my head before.

        Partner's Description
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Kevin depicted the coffee grinder with simple and direct description. 
        He captured and describe the most essencial part of the object 
        and describe them in a 3D dimension. Although I did not approach the image
        as 3D in my drawing, but I did have a really vivid image in my mind. 
        As a result, I was able to quickly form a 2D primitive drawing on my canvas.
      </p>
      
      
      <h3><br>
        Drawing & Pseudocode
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        When I draw the coffee grinder on the my paper, I form it with really simple shape 
        and straight-line to have a overall feeling of this object. And then, I imagined
        the color of each part in my mind before heading to the pseudocode. I originally wanted
        to add texture to the image, but I failed to apply it at the end. Hope I will be
        able to figure it out in close future. 
      </p>
      
      
       <h3><br>
        Differencces between Drawing & Coding
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        The pseudocode was deveoped based on my drawing logic, which is drawing the shape 
        and filling the color. In actual coding process, the logic is a little bit different
        from the order that we are drawing in an actual physical world. In coding, I need to 
        set the color for the shape and line before "drawing" on canvas. After careful consideration,
        the coding logic is also making sense, because, in real world, we may also need to
        pick the color and the size of the pen before drawing the stoke on paper. Although the major 
        difference is that we have choice to fill in the color of our pictures after finishing the 
        shape, but the computer seems don't. In P5.js, we need to decide the color and size before 
        actually "drawing" it. As a result, I took sometimes to understand the computer's logic on drawing, 
        before I actually did the actual coding.
        
        <br><br>On the other hand, the position adjustments on digital canvas also consumed a
        lot of time. When I drew on paper, I could simply connect one shape's side with another
        without doing any mathmatical caculation. When I coded using P5.js, I needed to try and 
        error in order to locate the ideal position for each shape. Since the circle and rectangle
        shape starting point is different, I need to pay extra attention on this situation when I 
        typed down the starting X,Y point in my code.
        
        <br><br>Last but not least, the hand-drew picture is more like a random sketch, but the
        drawing, that happened in digital platform, is more like a static line combination with 
        perfect allignment and shape. As a result, the digital version coffee grinder is more
        visiually appealing and united compared to the hand-drew version.
